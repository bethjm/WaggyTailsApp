# WaggyQuiz

This application was developed for WaggyTail Rescue, a dog and cat rescue organization based in NYC. The app serves as an educational resource for prospective pet owners, offering quizzes to test their knowledge of responsible pet ownership. WaggyTails conducts over 20+ pet adoptions per month.

While the app was developed with ReactNative, upon reflection it was decided that deploying it to the web would make it more easily accessible to perspective adopters.

***Access***

- **Interactive Quizzes:** Potential adopters can choose between a cat quiz or a dog quiz. The app dynamically prompts users with new questions, providing an engaging learning experience.

- **Scoring System:** At the end of the quiz, users receive a score indicating the number of correct answers. They can then review the questions they answered incorrectly to enhance their understanding of responsible pet ownership.
  
- **API Integration:** The app has an integrated API for the questions for each quiz, ensuring a seamless and up-to-date experience for users.

- **Platform Tech:** The app utilizes ReactNavigation for seamless data transfer between components. 

- **Web Deployment:** To enhance accessibility for prospective adopters, the app has been deployed on the web. It is hosted on Netlify for cost-effectiveness and easy redeployment.

***Platform Optimization***

- **Cross-Platform Design:** Originally intended for deployment on app stores (iOS and Android), the app's StyleSheet design is optimized for both mobile platforms and web.

Feel free to explore the quizzes, enhance your pet ownership knowledge, and share the app with fellow prospective pet owners. Thank you for supporting responsible pet ownership!
